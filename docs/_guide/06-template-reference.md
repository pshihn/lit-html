lit-html templates are written using JavaScript template literals tagged with the `html` tag. The contents of the literal are mostly plain, declarative, HTML:

```js
html`<h1>Hello World</h1>`
```

**Bindings** or expressions are denoted with the standard JavaScript syntax for template literals:

```js
html`<h1>Hello ${name}</h1>`
```

## Template Structure

lit-html templates must be well-formed HTML, and bindings can only occur in certain places. The templates are parsed by the browser's built-in HTML parser before any values are interpolated. 

**No warnings.** Most cases of malformed templates are not detectable by lit-html, so you won't see any warnings—just templates that don't behave as you expect—so take extra care to structure templates properly. 

Follow these rules for well-formed templates:

 *  Templates must be well-formed HTML when all expressions are replaced by empty values.

 *  Bindings **_can only occur_** in attribute-value and text-content positions.

    ```html
    <!-- attribute value -->
    <div label="${label}"></div>

    <!-- text content -->
    <div>${textContent}</div>
    ```


 *  Expressions **_cannot_** appear where tag or attribute names would appear.
    
    ```html
    <!-- ERROR --> 
    <${tagName}></${tagName}> 

    <!-- ERROR --> 
    <div ${attrName}=true></div>
    ```


 *  Templates can have multiple top-level elements and text.

 *  Templates **_should not contain_** unclosed elements—they will be closed by the HTML parser.

    ```js
    // HTML parser closes this div after "Some text"
    const template1 = html`<div class="broken-div">Some text`;
    // When joined, "more text" does not end up in .broken-div
    const template2 = html`${template1} more text. </div>`;
    ```

## Binding Types

Expressions can occur in text content or in attribute value positions.

There are a few types of bindings:

  * Text:

    ```js
    html`<h1>Hello ${name}</h1>`
    ```

    Text bindings can occur anywhere in the text content of an element.

  * Attribute:

    ```js
    html`<div id=${id}></div>`
    ```

  * Boolean Attribute:

    ```js
    html`<input type="checkbox" ?checked=${checked}>`
    ```

  * Property:

    ```js
    html`<input .value=${value}>`
    ```

  * Event Listener:

    ```js
    html`<button @click=${(e) => console.log('clicked')}>Click Me</button>`
    ```

### Event Listeners

Event listeners can be functions or objects with a `handleEvent` method. Listeners are passed as both the listener and options arguments to `addEventListener`/`removeEventListener`, so that the listener can carry event listener options like `capture`, `passive`, and `once`.

```js
const listener = {
  handleEvent(e) {
    console.log('clicked');
  },
  capture: true,
};

html`<button @click=${listener}>Click Me</button>`
```

## Supported Data Types

Each binding type supports different types of values:

 * Text content bindings: Many types, see [Supported data types for text bindings](#supported-data-types-for-text-bindings).

 * Attribute bindings: All values are converted to strings.

 * Boolean attribute bindings: All values evaluated for truthiness.

 * Property bindings: Any type of value.

 * Event handler bindings: Event handler functions or objects only.

### Supported data types for text bindings

Text content bindings accept a large range of value types:

*   Primitive values.
*   TemplateResult objects.
*   DOM nodes.
*   Arrays or iterables.

#### Primitive Values: String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined

Primitives values are converted to strings when interpolated into text content or attribute values. They are checked for equality to the previous value so that the DOM is not updated if the value hasn't changed.

#### TemplateResult

Templates can be nested by passing a `TemplateResult` as a value of an expression:

```js
const header = html`<h1>Header</h1>`;

const page = html`
  ${header}
  <p>This is some text</p>
`;
```

#### Node

Any DOM Node can be passed to a text position expression. The node is attached to the DOM tree at that point, and so removed from any current parent:

```js
const div = document.createElement('div');
const page = html`
  ${div}
  <p>This is some text</p>
`;
```

#### Arrays / Iterables

Arrays and Iterables of supported types are supported as well. They can be mixed values of different supported types.

```javascript
const items = [1, 2, 3];
const list = () => html`items = ${items.map((i) => `item: ${i}`)}`;
```

```javascript
const items = {
  a: 1,
  b: 23,
  c: 456,
};
const list = () => html`items = ${Object.entries(items)}`;
```

## Control Flow with JavaScript

lit-html has no built-in control-flow constructs. Instead you use normal JavaScript expressions and statements.

### Ifs with ternary operators

Ternary expressions are a great way to add inline-conditionals:

```js
html`
  ${user.isloggedIn
      ? html`Welcome ${user.name}`
      : html`Please log in`
  }
`;
```

### Ifs with if-statements

You can express conditional logic with if statements outside of a template to compute values to use inside of the template:

```js
getUserMessage() {
  if (user.isloggedIn) {
    return html`Welcome ${user.name}`;
  } else {
    return html`Please log in`;
  }
}

html`
  ${getUserMessage()}
`
```

### Loops with Array.map

To render lists, `Array.map` can be used to transform a list of data into a list of templates:

```js
html`
  <ul>
    ${items.map((i) => html`<li>${i}</li>`)}
  </ul>
`;
```

### Looping statements

```js
const itemTemplates = [];
for (const i of items) {
  itemTemplates.push(html`<li>${i}</li>`);
}

html`
  <ul>
    ${itemTemplates}
  </ul>
`;
```

## Built-in directives

Directives are functions that can extend lit-html by customizing the way a binding renders.

lit-html includes a few built-in directives.

*   [`asyncAppend` and `asyncReplace`](#asyncappend-and-asyncreplace)
*   [`cache`](#cache)
*   [`classMap`](#classmap)
*   [`ifDefined`](#ifdefined)
*   [`guard`](#guard)
*   [`repeat`](#repeat)
*   [`styleMap`](#stylemap)
*   [`unsafeHTML`](#unsafehtml)
*   [`until`](#until)

### asyncAppend and asyncReplace

`asyncAppend(asyncIterable)`<br>
`asyncReplace(asyncIterable)`

Location: text bindings

JavaScript asynchronous iterators provide a generic interface for asynchronous sequential access to data. Much like an iterator, a consumer requests the next data item with a call to `next()`, but with asynchronous iterators `next()` returns a `Promise`, allowing the iterator to provide the item when it's ready.

lit-html offers two directives to consume asynchronous iterators:

 * `asyncAppend` renders the values of an [async iterable](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration), appending each new value after the previous.

 * `asyncReplace` renders the values of an [async iterable](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration), replacing the previous value with the new value.

Example:

```javascript
import {asyncReplace} from 'lit-html/directives/async-replace.js';

const wait = (t) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, t));
/**
 * Returns an async iterable that yields increasing integers.
 */
async function* countUp() {
  let i = 0;
  while (true) {
    yield i++;
    await wait(1000);
  }
}

render(html`
  Count: <span>${asyncReplace(countUp())}</span>.
`, document.body);
```

In the near future, `ReadableStream`s will be async iterables, enabling streaming `fetch()` directly into a template:

```javascript
import {asyncAppend} from 'lit-html/directives/async-append.js';

// Endpoint that returns a billion digits of PI, streamed.
const url =
    'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/contrib/pi/pi-billion.txt';

const streamingResponse = (async () => {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  return response.body.getReader();
})();
render(html`π is: ${asyncAppend(streamingResponse)}`, document.body);
```

### cache

`cache(conditionalTemplate)`

Location: text bindings

Caches the rendered DOM nodes for templates when they're not in use. The `conditionalTemplate` argument is an expression that can return one of several templates. `cache` renders the current
value of `conditionalTemplate`. When the template changes, the directive caches the _current_ DOM nodes before switching to the new value. 

Example:

```js
import {cache} from 'lit-html/directives/cache.js';

const detailView = (data) => html`<div>...</div>`; 
const summaryView = (data) => html`<div>...</div>`;

html`${cache(data.showDetails
  ? detailView(data) 
  : summaryView(data)
)}`
```

When lit-html re-renders a template, it only updates the modified portions: it doesn't create or remove any more DOM than it needs to. But when you switch from one template to another, lit-html needs to remove the old DOM and render a new DOM tree. 

The `cache` directive caches the generated DOM for a given binding and input template. In the example above, it would cache the DOM for both the `summaryView` and `detailView` templates. When you switch from one view to another, lit-html just needs to swap in the cached version of the new view, and and update it with the latest data.

### classMap

`class=${classMap(classObj)}`

Location: attribute bindings (must be the only binding in the `class` attribute)

Sets a list of classes based on an object. Each key in the object is treated as a class name, and if the value associated with the key is truthy, that class is added to the element.

```js
import {classMap} from 'lit-html/directives/class-map.js';

let classes = { highlight: true, enabled: true, hidden: false };

html`<div class=${classMap(classes)}>Classy text</div>`;
// renders as <div class="highlight enabled">Classy text</div>
```

The `classMap` must be the only binding in the `class` attribute, but it can 
be combined with static values:

```js
html`<div class="my-widget ${classMap(dynamicClasses)}">Static and dynamic</div>`;
```

### ifDefined

`ifDefined(value)`

Location: attribute bindings

For AttributeParts, sets the attribute if the value is defined and removes the attribute if the value is undefined.

For other part types, this directive is a no-op.

Example:

```javascript
import {ifDefined} from 'lit-html/directives/if-defined';

const myTemplate = () => html`
  <img src="/images/${ifDefined(image.filename)}">
`;
```

### guard

`guard(dependencies, valueFn)`

Location: any

Renders the value returned by `valueFn`. Only re-evaluates `valueFn` when one of the 
dependencies changes identity. 

Where:

-   `dependencies` is an array of values to monitor for changes. (For backwards compatibility, 
     `dependencies` can be a single, non-array value.)
-   `valueFn` is a function that returns a renderable value.

`guard` is useful with immutable data patterns, by preventing expensive work
until data updates.

Example:

```js
import {guard} from 'lit-html/directives/guard';

const template = html`
  <div>
    ${guard([immutableItems], () => immutableItems.map(item => html`${item}`))}
  </div>
`;
```

In this case, the `immutableItems` array is mapped over only when the array reference changes.

### repeat 

`repeat(items, keyfn, template)`<br>
`repeat(items, template)`

Location: text bindings

Repeats a series of values (usually `TemplateResults`) generated from an
iterable, and updates those items efficiently when the iterable changes. When
the `keyFn` is provided, key-to-DOM association is maintained between updates by
moving DOM when required, and is generally the most efficient way to use
`repeat` since it performs minimum unnecessary work for insertions amd removals.

Example:

```js
import {repeat} from 'lit-html/directives/repeat';

const myTemplate = () => html`
  <ul>
    ${repeat(items, (i) => i.id, (i, index) => html`
      <li>${index}: ${i.name}</li>`)}
  </ul>
`;
```

If no `keyFn` is provided, `repeat` will perform similar to a simple map of
items to values, and DOM will be reused against potentially different items.

See [Repeating templates with the repeat directive](writing-templates#repeating-templates-with-the-repeat-directive) for a discussion
of when to use `repeat` and when to use standard JavaScript flow control. 

### styleMap

`style=${styleMap(styles)}`

Location: attribute bindings (must be the only binding in the `style` attribute)

The `styleMap` directive sets styles on an element based on an object, where each key in the object is treated as a style property, and the value is treated as the value for that property. For example:

```js
import {styleMap} from 'lit-html/directives/style-map.js';

let styles = { backgroundColor: 'blue', color: 'white' };
html`<p style=${styleMap(styles)}>Hello style!</p>`;
```

For CSS properties that contain dashes, you can either use the camel-case equivalent, or put the property name in quotes. For example, you can write the the CSS property `font-family` as either `fontFamily` or `'font-family'`:

```js
{ fontFamily: 'roboto' }
{ 'font-family': 'roboto' }
```

The `styleMap` must be the only binding in the `style` attribute, but it can 
be combined with static values:

```js
html`<p style="color: white; ${styleMap(moreStyles)}">More styles!</p>`;
```


### unsafeHTML

`unsafeHTML(html)`

Location: text bindings

Renders the argument as HTML, rather than text.

Note, this is unsafe to use with any user-provided input that hasn't been
sanitized or escaped, as it may lead to cross-site-scripting vulnerabilities.

Example:

```js
import {unsafeHTML} from 'lit-html/directives/unsafe-html.js';

const markup = '<div>Some HTML to render.</div>';
const template = html`
  Look out, potentially unsafe HTML ahead:
  ${unsafeHTML(markup)}
`;
```

### until

`until(...values)`

Location: any

Renders placeholder content until the final content is available. 

Takes a series of values, including Promises. Values are rendered in priority order, 
 with the first argument having the highest priority and the last argument having the 
 lowest priority. If a value is a Promise, a lower-priority value will be rendered until it resolves.

The priority of values can be used to create placeholder content for async
data. For example, a Promise with pending content can be the first
(highest-priority) argument, and a non-promise loading indicator template can
be used as the second (lower-priority) argument. The loading indicator
renders immediately, and the primary content will render when the Promise
resolves.

Example:

```javascript
import {until} from 'lit-html/directives/until.js';

const content = fetch('./content.txt').then(r => r.text());

html`${until(content, html`<span>Loading...</span>`)}`
```
