## lit-html Documentation 

This folder holds the source for the lit-html documentation site. Guides are written in Markdown, and the site is built using the Jekyll static site generator. 
 
This section describes how to build the documentation site.

### Prerequisites

To build the documentation site, you need Jekyll, Node, and npm.

If you already have Ruby and the gem pacakge manager, run the following command to install Jekyll:

`gem install bundler jekyll`

For more information, see [the Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Previewing the docs requires the [App Engine Standard Environment for Python 2.7](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/quickstart). 

### Setup

1. Clone or download a copy of this repo.

2. Install npm dependencies for the docs site.

     cd lit-html/docs
     npm install


### Building and previewing

To build the documentation site and preview it from a local server:

```
cd docs
npm run build
npm run serve
```

Point a browser at [localhost:9001](localhost:9001) to preview the site.
To use a different port, run:

```
npm run serve -- --port <PORTNUMBER>
```

The generated API docs are checked in, so you don't need to build the 
API docs unless you're making changes to the doc comments in the lit-html source.

To regenerate the API docs and rebuild the  site, run the following command:

`npm run build-all`
